    <h2>Educational Assessments</h2>
    <p>
    Learning difficulties can make children feel frustrated and unmotivated. An educational assessment uncovers the reasons why your child is having challenges in school and provides data regarding the intellectual, academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs of your child. Detailed reports, including recommendations, are provided after assessments. Emily's unique, child-centered approach, helps kids develop a presentation about themselves to develop self-awareness and advocate for their needs.
